This project is for a Christmas Gift for my Mom

The idea is simple:
 - Create a simple web server that can be viewed from a QR code
 - Create an index of 365 encouraging messages
 - Have the site cycle through the messages, one each day

That way I can print the QR code onto a coffee mug, stickers, or
anything else she may want.
